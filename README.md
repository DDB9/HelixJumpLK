Dear recipient,
Welcome to my technical assignment repository! 
For this assignment I have built a variant of the already known game "Helix Jump". As a unique twist, I have changed the game into a slower paced puzzle game with 2 helices instead of 1. The task for the player is to have both balls at the finishline to complete the level (3 in total as of now).
In here you will find all the files from the project including the .exe and .apk files which are located in HelixJumpLK/HelixJump/Build. 
You can download the repository using the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
If you have any questions please mail me at: ddebruijn9@gmail.com

Thank you for reviewing my assignment and hope to talk to you soon,
Daan.
